***Sparse-Matrix-Conversion***

This C++ program converts a user-inputted matrix into its sparse matrix representation using the 3-column format. It prompts for the number of rows and columns, reads the matrix elements, identifies non-zero values, and outputs the sparse matrix (with row, column, and value) along with the count of non-zero elements.
